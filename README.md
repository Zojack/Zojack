### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a programmer for C++ and JS.

I am based in Texas, and primarily do things centered around network engineering and audio software.

- For my frameworks and a bit more about myself, you can check my website [here](https://zojack.github.io/).

I also have an Upwork for this profile, which is also in my website.

If you are coming here from Upwork, deciding whether to invite me.

####  I hope I can get you a good product!
